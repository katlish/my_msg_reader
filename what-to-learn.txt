- promises VS callbacks
- import VS require
- typescript
    - tsconfig.json
    - how typescript compiler works (js file knows about types via map file)
    - strict modes of compiler (noImplicitAny will complain on missing types)
    - install typescript sa Dev dependency only, cause each project will use different versions
    - in order to define special types in the doc (like Server type) we need to install its lib 
- node js 
    - https://nodejs.org/api/
- debugger 
    - launch.json file is defining which doc is for debugging - "program": "${workspaceFolder}/msg-reader.ts"
- object oriented
    - design patterns
